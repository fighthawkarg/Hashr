Generate and compare hashes / checksums from files with this app.

This can be MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256. Currently must be a file manager installed to open files.

The "sum" files to open must be in official format like the GNU linux tools md5sum, sha1sum and sha256sum.

Permissions:

READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: for opening files from external storage like sd cards

WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: for writing generated checksum files to external storage like sd cards (optionally)
